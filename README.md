# ML-algorithms-for-Iris-classification
For this project I played around with and trained 2 machine learning algorithms: K nearest Neighbors classifier and decision tree classifier to see which would classify the iris data set more accurately. I experimented with splitting the data into different train and test sizes as well as the parameters of nearest neighbor. 

 To use this program:
1)	I would recommend to use the code on Jupiter notebooks as that is where I originally programmed it.
2)	Make sure you can use sklearn and joblib
